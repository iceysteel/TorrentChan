1. user hits server with request
2. chan server replies with client.html
3. client.html asks server for contents.json (need to come up with a cooler name)
4. client.html downloads threads and their 5 most recent posts as post.torrent(s)
5. if user is on thread page then poll server for updates every 30 secs?

server has no database, 

images and files arent saved onto the server at any point, even for seeding, users just seed them to eachother, just one big json file in memory (cause thats fast nigga)

moderation is done by the users and threads under a certain reputation are automatically hidden and not downloaded
